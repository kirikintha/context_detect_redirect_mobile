##Summary

This module adds a condition and reaction plug in for detecting mobile devices and redirecting to a url of your choice. Integrates with WURFL to look up device information reliably.

##How It works

You need to install context and wurfl and update wurfl's device list. Then you can just add the context on your own and the module will handle the device detection.

##Notes on Compatibility

##Limitations

##Contacting the Maintainer of This project

Please feel free to contact me via github or drupal.org. My handle is "kirikintha" it's easy to find me. Support requests should allow between 3-5 business days, and I have to reserve the right to push off new features to the next version. My plan is to have quarterly releases, unless there is an emergency bug that crashes everything, which I will do my best to resolve as quickly as I can.

Thank you very much for using my module, I hope it works for you bug free!
